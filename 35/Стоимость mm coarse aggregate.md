Mar 01,2020 · Aggregates influence the workability of plastic concrete and also the durability,strength,thermal properties,and density of hardened concrete.Particle size divides aggregates into two categories: fine and coarse.Most fine aggregates are sand and contain particles smaller than 3 8 in.(10 mm).PROPERTIES OF AGGREGATES FOR CONCRETESep 03,2017 · Aggregates are of two basic types: Coarse: crushed rock,gravel or screenings.Fine: fine and coarse sands and crusher fines.Aggregates should be clean,hard,and strong.The aggregate is usually washed to remove any dust,silt,clay,organic matter,or other impurities that would interfere with the bonding reaction with the cement paste.
