## Boron Is Not So Boring Thermo Fisher Scientific
Oct 24,2017 · Boron is not as flashy as gold,nor as elusive as rare earth metals,and not as well known as copper,but it is an important industrial metal nonetheless.In fact,a recent article on phys.org calls it the "unsung hero of the periodic table" and says that to call boron boring is a mistake.Boron is very versatile because it easily accepts electrons from other elements to form many.December 2018 Quarterly Activities Report29 January 2019 December 2018 Quarterly Activities Report HIGHLIGHTS • Exceptional Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) delivered for the flagship Fort Cady Project o DFS completed for Fort Cady Borate Project using US headquartered consultants Barr Engineering for the Study and RESPEC Consulting Inc for the conversion of Mineral Resource Estimates to Ore Reserves
