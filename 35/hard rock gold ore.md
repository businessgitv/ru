## Eight Natural Geologic Signs Pointing Toward Gold.
Rock Contact Zones and Faults: Many quartz veins and other hard rock gold deposits occur in "zones" along faults or at the contact of two different types of rock.Correct Topography: As a general concept,the coarser gold does tend to hang up farther upstream.In the deserts,most of the best residual placers form in areas with moderate to flat.What Is Gold Mining? How Is Gold Mined? Geology PageBarrick Gold Corporation has one of the largest open pit gold mines in North America located on its Goldstrike mine property in north eastern Nevada.Other gold mines use underground mining where tunnels or shafts extract the ore.South Africa has up to 3,900 meters (12,800 ft) underground deepest hard rock gold mine in the world.

## The Borax Method of Gold Extraction for Small Scale Miners
Mankind has been extracting gold from hard rock and alluvial deposits for more than three thousand years.Over this long history,many different methods have been used by enterprising miners.One of the earliest was a simple sheepskin left in a river to collect gold flecks within its fleece,leading to the myth of the Golden Fleece.In What Rock Formations Can Gold Be Found? SciencingIntrusive rock is typically very hard and erodes slowly.This allows the surrounding rock to be worn away by wind and water,leaving only the harder rock in place.Heavy particles,such as gold,are likely to accumulate against the harder rock while the lighter materials are more easily moved away.
