## Open pit mining Wikipedia
Open pit,open cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth,such as long wall mining.Open pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.Quarrying of Stones: Its Methods,Selection of Site.It differs from the mining of ores of metals in that whereas quarrying is an operation carried out entirely on the surface,mining involves digging below the ground,sometimes at considerable depth.A quarry is a place where different types of stones are extracted.Selection of Site for Quarrying of Stones.

Limestone.Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust.It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate,cement,lime and building stone are made.71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S.is either limestone or dolomite.Mining Surface mining BritannicaMining Mining Surface mining: It has been estimated that more than two thirds of the world's yearly mineral production is extracted by surface mining.There are several types of surface mining,but the three most common are open pit mining,strip mining,and quarrying.These differ from one another in the mine geometries created,the techniques used,and the minerals produced.
