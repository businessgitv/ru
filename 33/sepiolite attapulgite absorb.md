Oct 15,2018 · There have been significant advancements in the use of special clays as rheological additives in paint and coatings systems.Special clays such as sepiolite,attapulgite and smectites comprise a particular silicate subgroup in the clay family.All of them,under the appropriate processing conditions,produce gel structures that are able to behave as shear thinning and thixotropic fluids.Mineral: Attapulgite,Palygorskite DigitalfireMineral: Attapulgite,Palygorskite Notes.Attapulgite is a magnesium aluminum silicate clay of very fine particle size.It is also known as Fullers Earth and is closely related to Sepiolite mineral.Unlike bentonite (or montmorillonite) attapulgite crystals are needle shaped (acicular) rather than flat or flake like.

## Attapulgite Technical Data
The clay of attapulgite is fine and a bit greasy smooth,light in weight,crispy,and the fractured surface is like shells or in irregular shapes.Attapulgite has strong ability to absorb water.When it is wet,attapulgite shows plastic and adhesive properties; and when it gets dry,attapulgite does not shrink much and does not show cracks.Sepiolite IMA EuropeThe high surface area and porosity of sepiolite account for the remarkable adsorptive and absorptive properties of this clay.It adsorbs vapours and odours and can absorb approximately its own weight of water and other liquids.Sepiolite is a non swelling clay and its granules do not desintegrate even when saturated with liquids.

Sepiolite at 5 wt% into the soil decreases suction pressures in the soil,and for this reason,it increases water availability.Sepiolite is a very well known additive in feed for animals.Additives of sepiolite have the ability to agglomerate the feed ingredients,as well as to absorb existing moisture.ATTAPULGITE: PROPERTIES AND USES byAttapulgite had been used by industry for more than 40 years before it was recognized as a distinct clay mineral.Chemical composition and some of its properties were sufficiently similar to montmorillonite to cause this con fusion.In the 1940's,the structure was worked out by Bradley,and the
