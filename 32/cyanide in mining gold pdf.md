## Cyanide Leaching Chemistry & Gold Cyanidation
The reactions that take place during the dissolution of gold in cyanide solutions under normal conditions have been fairly definitely established.Most agree that the overall cyanide equation for leaching and cyanidation of gold is as follows: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O2 + 2 H20 = 4 NaAu(CN)2 + 4 NaOHCYANIDE Super Pit gold mineCyanide has been used to separate gold and silver from ore for over 120 years.Mining uses less than 20% of the global production of cyanide chemicals.Mines use as little cyanide as possible for environmental,safety,and economic reasons.Cyanide is used in the extraction process to dissolve gold.

## Improving the process performance of gold cyanide leaching.
In the gold mining industry today,cyanide leaching is the prevailing method for solubilizing and recovering gold.Most of the new gold that is mined each year is processed via adsorption of gold cyanide onto activated carbon (Fleming et al.2011).Typically,the carbon in pulp (CIP) or carbon in leach (CIL) process is used for gold recovery.CYANIDE MANAGEMENTCONTENTS ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS vi FOREWORD ix 1.0 INTRODUCTION 1 2.0 CYANIDE IN MINING 3 2.1 Cyanide in context 3 2.2 Gold extraction 5 2.3 Alternatives to cyanide 7 2.4 Cyanide treatment,recovery and reuse 7 2.5 Control of process losses 8 3.0 CYANIDE AND THE ENVIRONMENT 9 3.1 Cyanide ecotoxicology 9 CASE STUDY: Sunrise Dam gold mine,tailings and.
