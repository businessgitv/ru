## Height of overburden fracture based on key strata theory.
Among the three overburden zones (the caving zone,the fracture zone,and the continuous deformation zone) in longwall coal mining,the continuous deformation zone is often considered to be continuous without cracks,so continuum mechanics can be used to calculate the subsidence of overburden strata.Longwall coal mining,however,will induce the generation of wide cracks in the surface and.Compaction characteristics of the caving zone in a.Broken rock and coal—residual coal,plus material from the immediate roof and overlying strata—fill in the goaf,in an area termed the caving zone.Due to its high porosity and permeability,the caving zone contains gas and water,which may have originated from the mined coal seam,the adjacent unmined coal seam,or from any aquifer or surface river.Thus,studying the compaction.
