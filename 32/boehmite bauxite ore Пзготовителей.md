## What is the ore of bauxite? Quora
Bauxite is the principal aluminum ore consisting of a mixture of minerals,namely gibbsite (Al(OH)3),boehmite (γ AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α AlO(OH)),and the iron oxides goethite and hematite.It can also contain smaller amounts of the clay mineral.BauxiteBauxite Technical Note What is bauxite? Hence,the major deposits are generally close to the surface.Bauxite is a mixture of aluminium minerals,clay minerals,and insoluble materials.Three aluminium minerals can occur in bauxite: gibbsite,boehmite and diaspore.Bauxite is the world's principal source of aluminium and can vary

Bauxite residue is mainly composed of iron oxides,titanium oxide,silicon oxide and un dissolved alumina together with a wide range of other oxides which will vary according to the country of origin of the bauxite.The high concentration of iron compounds in the bauxite.Boehmite — Wikipedia Republished WIKI 2Boehmite or böhmite is an aluminium oxide hydroxide (γ AlO(OH)) mineral,a component of the aluminium ore bauxite.It is dimorphous with diaspore.It crystallizes in the orthorhombic dipyramidal system and is typically massive in habit.It is white with tints of yellow,green,brown or red due to impurities.It has a vitreous to pearly luster,a Mohs hardness of 3 to 3.5 and a specific.

Unlike the base metal ores,bauxite does not require complex processing because most of the bauxite mined is of an acceptable grade.Ore quality can be improved by relatively simple and inexpensive processes for removing clay,known as "beneficiation",which include washing,wet screening and mechanical or manual sorting.Bauxite Types and Uses Australian Bauxite LimitedBauxite Types and Uses.Bauxite Types and Uses.Bauxite is aluminium rich ore that is used for aluminium production (the metallurgical bauxites) and for production of refractory materials,chemicals or cements (the non metallurgical bauxites).Boehmite bauxites are sourced from Weipa in far northern Queensland,Gove in NT and from west.

## Refractory Grade Bauxite
The mining of crude refractory grade bauxite consists of the same methods and procedures that are customarily applied to the extraction of metallurgical grade bauxite ores.In fact,in some cases,special quality grades of bauxite are selectively mined simultaneously with associated metallurgical ore.Bauxite Geoscience AustraliaBauxite is a heterogeneous,naturally occurring material of varying composition that is relatively rich in aluminium.The principal minerals in bauxite are gibbsite (Al 2 O 3.3H 2 O),boehmite (Al 2 O 3.H 2 O) and diaspore,which has the same composition as boehmite,but is denser and harder.
