## Fly ash or GGBS? International Cement Review
Fly ash and ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS) are regarded as conventional cement constituents in much of the world.The proportions used in concrete making vary quite considerably and the price of the material is key when it comes to producing a cubic metre of concrete to the required specification at the lowest possible cost.Benefits of slag and fly ash ScienceDirectThe use of ground granulated blast furnace slag and powder coal fly ash as an addition to either cement or concrete is well established.Concrete made with these secondary raw materials as a part of the binder does show distinctive advantages over concrete with Portland cement only.

How can one distinguish between Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag and Iron Slag? Is chemical analysis important or is there another method?What is slag cementSlag cement is a hydraulic cement formed when granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is ground to suitable fineness and is used to replace a portion of portland cement.It is a recovered industrial by product of an iron blast furnace.Molten slag diverted from the iron blast furnace is rapidly chilled,producing glassy granules that yield.
