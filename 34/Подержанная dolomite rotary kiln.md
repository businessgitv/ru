## Coal based Direct Reduction Rotary Kiln Process IspatGuru
Coal based Direct Reduction Rotary Kiln Process.The coal based direct reduction rotary kiln process was developed for converting iron ore directly into metallic iron without the melting of the materials.The process has the advantage of low capital expenditure and no requirement of coking coal.Transforming stone into lime or dolime Lhoist Minerals.Mixed feed shaft kilns are usually constructed as a group of kilns in which the limestone (or dolomite) is mixed with a charge of solid fuel.Cooling air for the lime is blown in through the base to serve as combustion air for the fuel mixed with the stone at the head of the kiln.These kilns can generate extremely high temperature peaks.
