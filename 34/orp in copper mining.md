## Sodium hydrosulfide Wikipedia
Sodium hydrosulfide is the chemical compound with the formula NaHS.This compound is the product of the half neutralization of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) with sodium hydroxide.NaHS is a useful reagent for the synthesis of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds,sometimes as a solid reagent,more often as an aqueous solution.Solid NaHS is colorless,and typically smells like H 2 S owing to.CA6 Copper Electro Chemical DevicesThe CA6 Copper is offered in three ranges 0 5.000 mg L,0 50.00 mg L and 0 250.0 mg L.The measurement uses the Bathocuproine method with three reagents.Reagent 1,hydroxylamine reduces the copper to cuprous ion,Regent 2,citrate buffer adjusts the pH and Reagent 3,the Bathocuproine develops an orange color that is directly proportional to.
