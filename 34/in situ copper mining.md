## Mineral Deposit Value How to Calculate the Potential.
Before you can calculate the potential mineral deposit value,you first need to gather some specific data regarding the ore body and the individual drill results.This required data can be found in the mining company's press releases in which they announce their drill results.Make sure that this data is announced according to the guidelines of National Instrument 43 101 (i.e.approved by a.Recovery of Copper by Solution Mining Techniques AZGS.The mining practice that uses solutions to extract a desired commodity from an ore deposit where it stands without also extracting the rock is known as solution mining.There are essentially two types of solution mining: 1) in situ and 2) in place.

Such operations are amenable to recovering low grade ore,reducing many of the typical mining operations cost,and presenting environmental benefits.Hydraulic properties and characteristics of copper ore are investigated to assess the impact of permeability on flow capacity during in place,copper leaching operation.What Is in Situ Leaching? (with picture)In situ leaching is a process that is utilized in mining for the recovery of certain stated types of minerals that include uranium,gold and copper.The process requires that holes be drilled into the site where the deposit is located with the aim of creating portals through which certain liquid can be poured down to the deposit by the created portal.
